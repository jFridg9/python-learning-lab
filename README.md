# 🧠 Python Learning Lab

This repository is my personal **sandbox for learning Python**.  
It’s used for coursework, experiments, and Copilot-assisted practice.  
Each file or folder may represent a different concept, week, or lesson.

## 🗂️ Structure

| Folder/File | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|
| `main.py` | Active working file — current practice or experiment |
| `archive/` | Completed or older examples (keep for reference) |
| `notes/` | Reflections, explanations, and Copilot tutorials |
| `zybooks/` | Exercises based on IT-140 (Introduction to Scripting) |
| `physics/` | Optional physics-related scripts or calculations |

## 🧭 Guidelines

1. **Do not overwrite existing files** unless explicitly requested.  
2. Each new concept or task should go in its own file (e.g., `zybooks_1_2.py`).  
3. Include **clear comments** explaining what the code does and why.  
4. Treat this repo as a guided notebook — it’s okay to experiment, fail, and try again.  
5. Copilot agents should always:
   - Review this README for context before generating code.  
   - Explain key programming concepts (loops, functions, error handling, etc.) in plain English.  
   - Ask before modifying or replacing files.

## 🧩 Goals

- Strengthen understanding of programming fundamentals:
  - Data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and file I/O
- Practice clean coding and commenting habits
- Build confidence in Git, GitHub, and VS Code workflow
- Use Copilot as a **learning assistant**, not just a code generator

## 🚧 Work in Progress

**Current Focus:**  
Module One (IT-140) — basic Python syntax, input handling, and simple logic exercises.  
See `zybooks/1_1_to_1_2.py` for active work.
